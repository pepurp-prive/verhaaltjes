/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the creative writing application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their account data, settings, and associated story texts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information.
 * - /users/{userId}/settings/{settingsId}: Stores user-specific settings.
 * - /users/{userId}/story_texts/{storyTextId}: Stores additional story text content.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. There is no concept of shared or public access in this initial prototype.
 * - Listing of user documents is disabled to prevent unauthorized enumeration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'id' field within each document under /users/{userId} must match the 'userId' path segment. This is enforced on creation and update to maintain the ownership link.
